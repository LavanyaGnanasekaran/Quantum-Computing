# Project Structure:

I have implemented RSA in Qiskit and FGPA using VHDL. Qiskit is programmable through Jupyter Notebook using Python programming language. Jupyter Notebooks and re-usable Python functions are available inside `qiskit` folder. VHDL code responsible for running RSA algorithm in FPGA is available inside `vhdl` folder.
